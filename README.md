This repository contains the coding of my MSc thesis on radar diagnostics for convective wind gusts in Switzerland. 
The polarimetric and cartesian radar data is provided by MeteoSwiss. The thesis consists of analyzing the synoptic 
weather situations prior to the five selected heavy thunderstorms and of RHI, CAPPI, PPI illustrating the state
of the thunderstorm shortly before or at the time of possible wind gusts from a radar perspecitve.
